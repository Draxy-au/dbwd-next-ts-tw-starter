This is my base starter for a Next.js and TypeScript project.

Included in the setup is:

- Next.js (powerful React framework)
- TypeScript (enforce stronger typing)
- eslint (check semantics of the code)
- Prettier (check format of the code)
- Husky (pre-commit checks)

Configuration:

- absolute paths configured in tsconfig.json
- pre-commit checks through husky implemented, configured in husky/pre-commit file
